# Scope of the project
Employees can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected using this application. The Application was created by modifying a given starter code.

# Workflow
The code begins by prompting the user for the length of the password and storing the length in a variable.
It then checks if the length is a number between 10 and 70 as required
It also prompts the user to try again if the length is not correct. 
The function prompts the user to confirm if they want special characters, numbers, lowercase or uppercase characters and stores them. The code also ensures that at least one character type is selected. If not, it prompts the user to select at least one. Finally, the function stores the length chosen and the options in regards to the different characters.
 
The Application is written to generate a password based on the user's options stored in the first function.
